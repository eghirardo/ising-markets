### Ising Markets

This repo contains the source code for my BSc thesis.

The thesis, titled "Beyond Geometric Brownian Motion: Statistical Physics Approaches to Financial Market Dynamics", consists of motivating, analysing and simulating the price dynamics model introduced in the paper "Expectation bubbles in a spin model of markets: Intermittency from frustration across scales" by Stefan Bornholdt.

Abstract:
This thesis investigates the application of statistical physics, and in particular spin models, to the study of financial market dynamics. Beginning with a review of the main models in financial mathematics, such as the Black-Scholes framework, we highlight their limitations in capturing empirical features observed in real markets, including volatility clustering and fat-tailed return distributions. Motivated by these shortcomings, we explore the field of econophysics and its potential to provide alternative insights into market behavior. We focus on the Bornholdt model—a simple yet powerful spin-based agent model that incorporates both trend-following and contrarian strategies—to model the price dynamics of risky assets. Through a combination of analytical derivations and numerical simulations, the model is shown to reproduce key stylized facts of financial time series. The results underscore both the promise and the limitations of physics-inspired approaches in understanding the complex, collective behavior of financial markets.
