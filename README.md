### Ising Markets

This repo contains the source code for my BSc thesis.

The thesis, titled "Beyond Geometric Brownian Motion: Statistical Physics Approaches to Financial Market Dynamics", consists of motivating, analysing and simulating the price dynamics model introduced in the paper "Expectation bubbles in a spin model of markets: Intermittency from frustration across scales" by Stefan Bornholdt.
