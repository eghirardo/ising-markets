    abstract = {This book presents a unified approach to a rich and rapidly evolving research domain at the interface between statistical physics, theoretical computer science/discrete mathematics, and coding/information theory. The topics which have been selected, including spin glasses, error correcting codes, satisfiability, are central to each field. The approach focuses on the limit of large random instances, adopting a common formulation in terms of graphical models. It presents message passing algorithms like belief propagation and survey propagation, and their use in decoding and constraint satisfaction solving. It also explains analysis techniques like density evolution and the cavity method, and uses them to derive phase diagrams and study phase transitions.},

abstract="The classic model of the temporal variation of speculative prices (Bachelier 1900) assumes that successive changes of a price Z(t) are independent Gaussian random variables. But, even if Z(t) is replaced by log Z(t),this model is contradicted by facts in four ways, at least:(1)Large price changes are much more frequent than predicted by the Gaussian; this reflects the ``excessively peaked'' (``leptokurtic'') character of price relatives, which has been well-established since at least 1915.(2)Large practically instantaneous price changes occur often, contrary to prediction, and it seems that they must be explained by causal rather than stochastic models.(3)Successive price changes do not ``look'' independent, but rather exhibit a large number of recognizable patterns, which are, of course, the basis of the technical analysis of stocks.(4)Price records do not look stationary, and statistical expressions such as the sample variance take very different values at different times; this nonstationarity seems to put a precise statistical model of price change out of the question.",

    abstract = {In this article we test the random walk hypothesis for weekly stock market returns by comparing variance estimators derived from data sampled at different frequencies. The random walk model is strongly rejected for the entire sample period (1962–1985) and for all subperiods for a variety of aggregate returns indexes and size-sorted portfolios. Although the rejections are due largely to the behavior of small stocks, they cannot be attributed completely to the effects of infrequent trading or time-varying volatilities. Moreover, the rejection of the random walk for weekly returns does not support a mean-reverting model of asset prices.},
