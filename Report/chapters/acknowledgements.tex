\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor, Professor Malatesta, not only for his invaluable guidance with the analytical results, but above all for his patience and consistently positive attitude throughout this project.

As this thesis marks the final step of three extraordinary years at Bocconi, I also wish to extend my deepest thanks, appreciation, and affection to the little study group that became a safe space and a second family to me. Dear Elisa, Filippo, Giuseppe, and Paco, thank you. Without you, I would not have such fond and lasting memories of this experience. As our academic paths will now diverge, I know our lives will remain closely connected.

This journey would not have been possible without the constant support of my family. I am especially grateful to my sister, Maria, who has always offered sound advice and helped me stay on the right path. I am eternally thankful to my parents, Carlo and Raffaella, who have taught me the value of an honest day's work. Many such days have gone into this journey, and I hope to make you proud.
